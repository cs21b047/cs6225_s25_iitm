# Course Website

This course website, including all of the lecture materials, lives
[here](http://kcsrk.info/cs6225_s25_iitm/).

# Software

We need Coq and F\* for this course. It is easiest to install them using
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager. Install opam for
your OS using [these
instructions](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Binary-distribution). It
is recommended that you use Linux or macOS for this course.

## Coq

Then follow the instructions below install `coq`:

```bash
$ opam switch create cs6225 4.14.0 #create a fresh opam switch named cs6225 with OCaml 4.14.0
$ eval $(opam env --switch=cs6225)
$ opam pin add coq 8.16.0 #Install coq
$ opam install coqide #Install coqide
```

## F*

We will use [VSCode
devcontainers](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/vscode-devcontainers) for F*
parts. You can start dev container with all the dependencies by

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs6225_s25_iitm
$ cd cs6225_s25_iitm
$ code . #start VSCode from root directory of the cloned repo
```

VSCode will prompt that it has found a dev container in the repo and whether to
reopen the folder to develop in a container. Click on "Reopen in container".
Among the two options shown in the command palette at the top, choose "CS6225 F*
devcontainer (from DockerHub)" option. This will download 2.5GB docker image
(takes a while) and reopens the project in the devcontainer.
