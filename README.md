# CS6225 : Programs and Proofs

This is the website for the [Spring 2025 course "Programs and
Proofs"](https://kcsrk.info/cs6225_s25_iitm) at the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

## Coq sources

The lecture materials are available in `lectures/`. In order to step through the
lectures in CoqIDE, you will first need to build the Frap library in `frap/`. To
build, ensure that you have [a Coq distribution
installed](https://kcsrk.info/cs6225_s25_iitm/resources/). 

The frap library can be built by:

```bash
$ cd frap
$ make
```

Then you can open the `*.v` files in CoqIDE and step through.
